The fog clung heavy to the shore, muffling the crash of the waves. From the mist, shapes emerged—massive, armored figures wading through the surf, their red eyes burning like embers. Behind them, a warship loomed, its flag snapping in the bitter wind.

Sergeant Markov tightened his grip on his rifle. His boots sank into the wet sand, but he didn’t move. He couldn’t. The stories had been true, then—legends whispered among the ranks about the enemy’s new weapon: iron giants, half-machine, half-man, forged in the dark of war.

The machines trudged forward, water swirling around their knees, each step shaking the earth. They carried weapons too large for any man, chains of ammunition dragging like serpents.

Markov’s breath caught. He was alone, cut off from his unit, with nothing but the rifle in his hands. And yet, as the colossal soldiers advanced, he planted his feet and raised his weapon.

He thought of his home, of the villages burning behind him, of the countless faces depending on someone—anyone—to stand their ground.

The first giant lifted its gun.

Markov exhaled slowly. One soldier against an army of iron. But better to fall here, facing them, than to live running.

And so he fired.

The crack of his rifle split the fog, the first defiant sound of resistance against the march of steel.
