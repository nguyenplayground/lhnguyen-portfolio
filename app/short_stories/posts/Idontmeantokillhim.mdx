summary: 'Two boys sneak into an abandoned house that local legends call haunted. Inside, they discover the building isn’t empty but alive.'
---

The old house had no name, only whispers. Its roof sagged like a tired back, its windows shattered into jagged teeth. The neighborhood kids swore it was haunted. They said the house could breathe. They said if you stood too close, you could hear it whisper your name.

Tom and Danny didn’t believe any of that. Or maybe they just didn’t want to.

“Come on,” Tom said, tugging at his backpack straps. “It’s just wood and dust. We’ll look around, then tell the others we saw the ghost. Easy.”

Danny hesitated at the gate, which leaned under its own rust. “And what if the ghost doesn’t like us lying?” His voice cracked on the last word, but Tom only smirked.

“There’s no ghost,” Tom said. “It’s just a house.”

The front door groaned when they pushed it open, a sound too much like a sigh. The air inside was thick, damp with mold. Shafts of pale light cut through the gloom, catching motes of dust that floated like ash from some invisible fire.

Danny swallowed hard. “Smells like something’s rotting.”

“Probably a raccoon or something,” Tom said, though his own nose wrinkled. He marched ahead anyway, his sneakers crunching glass.

The hall stretched long, with paint peeling from the walls in curling strips. Broken furniture huddled in corners, like shadows too heavy to move. Every step seemed to echo louder than it should have, as though the walls were listening.

Then they saw it.

At first, Danny thought it was just water damage—a wet patch in the corner where plaster had rotted through. But the patch swelled, shimmered, and blinked. A single enormous eye stared at them from the far wall, unblinking and wet.

“Jesus Christ,” Danny whispered.

Below the eye, a mouth opened, stretching wide across the cracked plaster. Its teeth looked like shards of broken windows jammed into raw gums. Tentacles unfurled from the shadows around it, black and glistening, curling across the ceiling beams like roots looking for something to hold.

Tom froze. His heart hammered, but his body refused to move. He felt the eye looking into him, deeper than skin, deeper than bone.

Danny grabbed his arm. “We need to go. Now.”

But Tom couldn’t. His legs felt nailed to the floor. His chest ached as though something heavy pressed down on it.

Danny tugged harder. “Tom, don’t just stand there—”

And then Tom’s hands moved. Only they weren’t his anymore. They jerked, stiff, like marionette strings pulled tight. He tried to pull back, to let go of Danny’s arm, but the grip only tightened. His fingers dug into his friend’s skin.

“Tom! Let go—you’re hurting me!”

“I—I can’t,” Tom gasped, his voice shaking. His hands shoved Danny hard, harder than he ever could on his own. Danny stumbled backward toward the gaping mouth in the wall.

The eye blinked slowly, hungrily.

“No! Danny, I don’t mean to—”

The shadows surged. Tentacles lashed out, wrapping Danny’s body, dragging him toward the teeth. His scream tore through the hallway, echoing off the walls before the house seemed to swallow it whole.

And then—silence.

Tom fell to his knees, his hands trembling, slick with something warm and red. His breath came in broken sobs.

“I don’t mean to kill my friend,” he whispered, over and over, as if the house might let him undo it.

But the eye only stared, its pupil wide and endless. The mouth curled into something like a smile, and the door behind Tom creaked shut.

The house had taken its due.
